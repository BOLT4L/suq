# SUQ - Handmade Products E-commerce
# Overview
SUQ is a simple e-commerce web application designed for selling handmade products. This project was developed during my junior year, focusing on fundamental web development concepts and practices. It serves as a foundational example of an online storefront, allowing users to browse products, add items to a cart, and proceed through a basic checkout process.

# Features
SUQ includes core functionalities typical of an e-commerce platform:

Product Listing: Browse a catalog of handmade products with images and descriptions.

Product Details: View detailed information for individual products.

Shopping Cart: Add desired products to a persistent shopping cart.

User Accounts (Basic): Simple user registration and login.

Basic Checkout: A simplified process for completing a purchase.

# Technologies Used
This project leverages a traditional web development stack:

Backend Logic: PHP

Frontend Structure: HTML

Styling: CSS

Interactivity: JavaScript

Local Development Environment: XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP)

# Getting Started
To get SUQ up and running on your local machine, you'll need XAMPP.

# Prerequisites
XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP from the official Apache Friends website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

# Installation Steps
Start XAMPP Services:

Open the XAMPP Control Panel.

Start the Apache and MySQL services.

# Place Project Files:

Navigate to the htdocs directory within your XAMPP installation (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows).

Create a new folder for your project, for example, suq-ecommerce.

Copy all the project files (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP files) into this suq-ecommerce folder.

# Database Setup:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.

If your project uses a MySQL database:

Create a new database (e.g., suq_db).

Import your database schema (e.g., from an .sql file if you have one) into this new database.

Ensure your PHP connection code (e.g., config.php or similar) is updated with the correct database name, username (usually root), and password (usually empty).

Access the Application:

Open your web browser.

Navigate to http://localhost/suq-ecommerce/ (replace suq-ecommerce with the actual folder name you created).
